For which teammate did you implement “Microservice A”?
    A. Jamie Bartels

What is the current status of the microservice? Hopefully, it’s done!
    A. Complete!

How is your teammate going to access your microservice? Should they get your code from GitHub (if so, provide a link to your public or private repo)? Should they run your code locally? Is your microservice hosted somewhere? Etc.
    A. Jamie is able to pull my code from Github at this link. 

If your teammate cannot access/call YOUR microservice, what should they do? Can you be available to help them? What’s your availability?
If your teammate cannot access/call your microservice, by when do they need to tell you?
Is there anything else your teammate needs to know? Anything you’re worried about? Any assumptions you’re making? Any other mitigations / backup plans you want to mention or want to discuss with your teammate?
